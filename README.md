# Snakes
AI 2024/2025 project, trying to match the global ranking from last year when I was evaluated.

Doing for fun in my free time.

# Notes: 

Still in initial phase of develpment, still needs much more work to constantly get a lenght of 100.

An algorith should help a lot in this specific project (I'm just trying something xD).

Prioritize speed of choice on the student.py (where you develop the AI), match cases helps in specific scenarios in the code such as the fastest way to forbid some plays, the rest doesnt need match case for now.

**Remember that the eveluator's pc is slower and will run everything at once, from the experience gained last year you should get in your pc about 200 to 300 of average score, then in DG's computer you will get the 100 needed.**

Diogo Gomes will not accept the excuse "No meu pc chego facilmente ao pedido e muito mais", he will anwser with "Mas num projeto tu não dás o teu computador ao cliente". Not my case but many had that problem and they got terrible grades because the thinking process should be running your game in a much slower pc, hence the speed factor importance in some parts of the code.
